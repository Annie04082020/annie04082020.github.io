# Annie Huang - Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and educational background. It is built from scratch with a focus on clean, modern design and robust multi-language support.

## ✨ Features
*   **Multi-Language Support**: Fully translated into English (`en`), Traditional Chinese (`zh`), and Japanese (`jp`), with a custom-styled dropdown selector for seamless switching.
*   **Light & Dark Modes**: Complete theme support with smooth transitions, automatically adjusting based on the user's preference or toggled manually via a custom moon/sun icon switch.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built using modern CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure a perfect layout across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Minimalist & Modern Aesthetic**: Features a custom "physical monitor frame" border effect, glassmorphic navigation bar, subtle hover micro-animations on cards, and coordinated color themes.
*   **Zero Dependencies**: Built entirely with plain HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript—no heavy frameworks or external libraries.
