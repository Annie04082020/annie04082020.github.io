# Welcome to my Journal! 🚀

This is my new personal space where I log my learning progress, daily reflections, and current activities. It perfectly matches my minimalist site aesthetic while allowing me to easily write updates exactly like this using Markdown files! 

### Here is what my current roadmap looks like:
*   Prepping for the Taekwondo National Intercollegiate Athletic Games this April! 🥋
*   Thinking about taking the 3rd Dan Promotion Test in June.
*   Researching and planning ahead for my Summer Internship at NSW in Kitakyushu, Japan! 🗾
*   Browsing Graduate school options.

### Code Example
Because the journal uses Markdown, I can even properly drop code snippets into it if I am documenting a project issue:
```python
def reverse_course_history():
    print("This makes logging my progress so easy!")
```

Stay tuned for more consistent updates directly in this section!
